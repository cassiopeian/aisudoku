 Aisudoku is a fun, frozen spin on the number puzzle Sudoku. Players must fill each column, row, and 3 × 3 grid with one of each of the nine given desserts, in place of the game’s typical digits.

 Aisu (Japanese for *ice*) is the Aisudoku mascot. He keeps the grid cells cool, so they can be filled with frozen treats, and he livens up your browser tab.

 Aisudoku was built with jQuery version 3.4.1.
