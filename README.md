 Aisudoku is a fun, frozen spin on the number puzzle Sudoku. Players must fill each column, row, and 3 × 3 grid with one of each of the nine given desserts, in place of the game’s typical digits.

 Aisu (Japanese for *ice*) is the Aisudoku mascot. He keeps the grid cells cool, so they can be filled with frozen treats, and he livens up your browser tab.

## Tech Specs

 Aisudoku was built with jQuery version 3.4.1.
