## Introduction 

 ![Homepage screenshot](images/read-me/homepage.png "Homepage screenshot")

 Aisudoku is a fun, frozen spin on the number puzzle Sudoku. Players must fill each column, row, and 3 × 3 grid with one of each of the nine given desserts, in place of the game’s typical digits.

## Features
 
 ### Multiple Puzzles

 Use the arrows under the grid, to navigate from one puzzle to the next. Otherwise, click the grinning puzzle piece at the top of the page, to open a menu.

 ### Use Color to Mark Guesses

 Expand the Tips menu, for a rundown on the way you can use color to make notes for yourself (e.g., in the screenshot, above, the green cell is correct, the red cell denotes a mistake, and the indigo cell is currently selected).

 ### See Overlooked Cells

 The *Check Your Solution* button will let you know whether you’ve solved the puzzle correctly. If you’ve accidentally left an ice cube in a cell, you’ll receive a notification. Once you click *Continue*, the missed cell (or cells) will glow.

 Aisu (Japanese for *ice*) is the Aisudoku mascot. He keeps the grid cells cool, so they can be filled with frozen treats, and he livens up your browser tab.
